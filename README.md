# circuit design

## 1. Differential Equation of Xnor-SR model

- gate_para.py: Generating two libraries of gate parameters for the input-output response functions of each promoter 

## 2. Biological Circuits optimization 

- plasmid_dict.py:  is the processing /database/document.json which is a corrected version of the output of the Cello2 plasmids database.
- logic_fun.py : functions collections module
- logic_BESS.py: Generating 4-1 boolean functions with optimal network of NOR gates from BESS NAND gates library.
